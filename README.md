# Article-Search-EngineManagement-System-DBMS

The Articles Search Engine System is a project that involves the use of a database management system (DBMS) to create a platform for users to publish and read articles. 
The system will include a user interface where users can register and log in as either a registered user or an admin. Registered users will be able to publish articles, 
while other users will be able to search for and read articles on the platform. The DBMS will be used to store and manage all the data related to users, articles, and searches.
This will involve designing a schema to represent the relationships between different entities, such as users and articles, and implementing it using SQL. 
The system will also need to incorporate features such as user authentication and authorization, article publishing, and search functionality. By using a DBMS to manage the data, 
the Articles Search Engine System can ensure that the platform is scalable, efficient, and secure.
